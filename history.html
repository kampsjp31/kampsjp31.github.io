									<h3>The Canonical history of Jotties</h3>
								  <p>Picture this: it's sometime in 2018. Jordan's wife Jessica has a standing drink hang with a friend every Wednesday night. Rather than sitting around at home, Jordan ask if Brooks wants to also have a standing drink hang on Wednesday nights. After weeks of trying different spots for the best deals around Wicker Park, the two landed on Lotties in Bucktown. $5 chicken sandwiches, $5 (heavy) pours of Breckenridge Bourbon. <strong>IMAGINE!</strong></p>
								  <p>But it gets even better! Lo and behold, Lotties started hosting Game of Thrones trivia on Wednesday nights. Being huge fans of the show, we decided to invite some friends to join us. We <strong>dominated</strong> the competition (mostly). This built the personnel from just the two to several. This went of for some time. Every wednesday, trivia and drinks at Lotties. Untill...</p>
									<p>We all know what happened in March 2020. Everything shuts down. No more cheap drinks and trivia at Lotties. We were truly <strong>thirsty.</strong> It was May or June of 2020, on a particularily nice day when Jordan said to Brooks "Man, on days like this I just want to drink outside in my garage". To which Brooks replied "Let's fucking do it!" And so Jotties was born (Jordan's Lotties)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
